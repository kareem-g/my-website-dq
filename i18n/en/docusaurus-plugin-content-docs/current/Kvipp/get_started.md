# Get started

We've created Kvipp to make documenting equipment-specific training in the field super easy, with no preparation required. Here's a guide to get you started.

## Go to the kvipp.it website
Kvipp is accessible via your usual web browser on mobile, tablet and PC. There's no app to download. [Click here to go to kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)

## Scan your HSE card (or other ID card)
Identify yourself with your HSE card, driving licence or passport. **We recommend the HSE card as the training will automatically be added to the correct company.**  We use the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority's HSE card API to get the latest updated information on your first name, surname, date of birth and company.

+ HSE card: Use the QR code option and scan the QR code on your HSE card.
+ Passport or driving licence: Take a picture of the front of your driving licence (or passport) including your name and date of birth. Artificial intelligence will interpret the image, and you can confirm if it's correct.

import scanHSEcard from '/img/scanHSEcard.jpg';

<img src={scanHSEcard} style={{width:200}} />

You can also add your email address under your name. This will automatically send you all training certificates.

import kvipp_screenshot_person from '/img/kvipp_screenshot_person.jpg';

<img src={kvipp_screenshot_person} style={{width:200}} />

## Scan or take a picture of the equipment you'll be using
+ QR codes: Use the QR code option and scan QR codes from DigiQuip, Reginn (M-reg) or BRAREG.
+ Recognition: Take a picture that includes the make and model, e.g. the serial number plate.

import imageAI from '/img/imageAI.jpg';

<img src={imageAI} style={{width:200}} />

Test it! Scan the QR code below:

import tommestokk from '/img/tommestokk.jpg';

<img src={tommestokk} style={{width:400}} />

**Now you can test out how to register, check and give training to others.**

## Training Status
Once both the person and equipment are identified, you'll see your training status.

**Training missing.** "Oops! You lack the competence to use this equipment" means that no documentation has been registered. You can then either upload previous documentation, complete a self-declaration or find someone who can provide training.

**Training complete.** "Good to go" tells you that the documentation is in place. You can now also download training certificates and provide training to others.

## Once you have registered that you can use the equipment, you can provide training to others.
Select "give training" and go through the general checklist. Add the participants at the end of the session.

# For ongoing overview
In Kvipp Admin, all training is updated in real time. As a manager, you can easily find out what training your people have, who can use which equipment and, importantly, group equipment and people to keep track of any gaps and progress.

# Get started!

To ensure everyone documents their training in Kvipp, we recommend communicating the importance of this and making it easy to remember. A couple of tricks that can make it easier to remember are to put up information and make sure the website is saved to the home screen.

## Information
Ensure all employees are aware that training must be documented digitally via [kvipp.it](https://kvipp.it)

## Posters
Use posters as reminders. Download them from here or contact us for prints.
