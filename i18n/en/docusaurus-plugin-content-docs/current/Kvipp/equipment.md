# Equipment
## Identifying Machines and Equipment

**Artificial intelligence and machine learning** enable equipment recognition using images. For the system to correctly identify the equipment, it's crucial to find specific characteristics indicating its brand and model. Look for the following:

+ Serial number plate: Usually brand model is stated on the plate.
+ QR codes: If the equipment has a QR code, the system can read it automatically, simplifying the process. **Scan a QR code** from DigiQuip, Reginn, Kvipp or BRAREG, and the information will be interpreted.

Kvipp Bedrift customers can **add equipment manually**.  The "asset owner" role grants the user the ability to search for and manually add equipment. In Kvipp Bedrift, go to "permissions" and grant access to the relevant personnel. In Kvipp, the person will automatically be able to add equipment via "search for brand and model".

## How do I get equipment into Kvipp Bedrift?
Equipment is automatically added as training is registered.

## Mark equipment (recommended)
With Kvipp Bedrift, you can also mark equipment with QR codes. QR codes make it easier for employees to check the status of their training and documentation.

While the solution uses advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning libraries, it's important to be aware that there's always a risk of incorrect information registration. For example, if a person scans a machine and overlooks that it's the wrong type, the machine will be incorrectly registered. This means the type added to the training certificate will also be incorrect.

**Linking a QR code:**
Under "permissions" in Kvipp Bedrift, you define who can link a QR code. This role is called "equipment owner".

Then the equipment can be marked, best done on-site:
+ Take a picture of the equipment, ensuring the make and model information is correct.
+ Select "link QR code".
+ Done!
