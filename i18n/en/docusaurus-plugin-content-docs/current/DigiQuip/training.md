# Training

In DigiQuip, equipment-specific training can be conducted either digitally or practically. Training involves providing necessary instruction for the safe use of work equipment. There's no escaping the fact that the definition of necessary training is subjective and challenging. Our contribution is to facilitate good alternatives.

:::tip[Remember!]
Necessary training must be tailored to each individual based on their experience and the type of training that suits them. Training is always the responsibility of the employer and must consider experience, motivation, and abilities.
:::

If the person has little experience with, for example, dump trucks, we recommend that training be provided by a colleague or others who know the machine. We refer to this as practical training. However, if the person has more experience, the need for training is not as great and necessary instruction can be in the form of a video. We refer to this as digital training.

## Do a practical training

Practical training, one-on-one or in a group, is generally very effective. The trainer can demonstrate in the field how to use the equipment, cover important safety considerations, and participants can ask questions.

Practical training can be initiated either from the machine side or the model side:

* Scan the equipment's QR code or NFC tag to start training from there, or
* Search for the machine and start training.
* When you scan the equipment, you'll find practical training in the "equipment-specific training" section, for example:

Finally, all participants are added to the session by scanning the QR code on the instructor's phone. Participants receive immediate documentation of their training.

Who can provide training is determined by the organization:

* All registered users regardless of organization,
* Registered users with approved competence, or
* Selected instructors.

## Do a digital training

Digital training starts either from the machine side or the model side. Scan the equipment's QR code or NFC tag to access digital training, similar to practical training.

Digital training consists of three steps: Video, user manual, and quiz (mandatory).

## Create digital training

**Navigate to "Competence > Digital Training" to add videos and create quizzes.** Remember to set the setting to "local training". If you wish to reuse videos and quizzes from another model, you can use the "copy from another model" button.

To create digital training with video and a concluding test, here are some general content tips:

1. **Application**: Describe the intended use, maximum load, maximum slope, wind speed, and lateral impact. Include capacity and key technical data.

2. **General safety**: Highlight usage limitations, key functions, vibration and noise levels, and recommended protective clothing and equipment.

3. **Pre-use inspection**: Explain how to conduct this inspection thoroughly.

4. **Operation**: Cover preparations, starting and stopping procedures, operational functions, smart usage tips (economic and environmental considerations), parking procedures, misuse prevention, and more.

5. **Hazard and warning labels**: Review the meanings and importance of hazard and warning labels.

## Add videos:

To add a video link from YouTube to DigiQuip, follow these steps:

1. **Create a company account on YouTube** if you don't already have one. You can create an account by visiting YouTube's website and following the instructions there.

2. **Upload the video to YouTube.** When uploading the video, ensure you set the privacy settings to "Public" so that the video can be shared and viewed in DigiQuip.

3. **Once the video is uploaded and publicly accessible,** copy the URL link of the video from the address bar of your browser.

4. **Log in to DigiQuip** and navigate to the section where you can add digital training or edit existing training.

5. **Find the option to add a video link.** Paste the URL link of the YouTube video and save your changes.

Now users will be able to access the video directly from DigiQuip during a training.

## Create quiz:
We suggest creating 7-10 questions with three answer choices. Each answer choice should have one correct answer. The questions must relate to the instructional video and/or user manual, and ensure the test is as practical as possible.

Remember to define the passing threshold for the test. The passing threshold is automatically set at 80% correct answers.

Disclaimer: DigiQuip is not responsible for creating content or assessing the learning outcome of the training.

:::tip[Practical and considerate questions]
Avoid trick questions! These can make it particularly challenging for dyslexic individuals, among others. In general, it's wise to aim for short and precise questions and answers. **Remember that the goal of the training is for the person to manage using the equipment safely.**
