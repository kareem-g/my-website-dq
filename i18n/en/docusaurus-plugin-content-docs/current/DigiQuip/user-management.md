# User management

The roles "Administrator" and "Users and competence management" can handle users. "Administrator" has access to everything and everyone, while "Users and competence management" has access to others in the same department.

## Departments and users

First, add the relevant departments. Departments are located as part of settings, "settings > general > departments". Only "Administrator" can manage departments.

Users can be added manually, through file import (CSV and Excel), or via integration. Users are located in "settings > users".

For CSV/Excel import, add the following information in the given order:

1.First name.
2.Last name.
3.Email. This will be the person's username and cannot be changed.
4.Phone. For Norwegian phone numbers: 8 digits without the country code.
5.Country code. For Norwegian phone numbers add 47, without + and 00.
6.Language. Use NO for Norwegian. An overview of other country codes can be downloaded from the solution.
7.Department. If the department has not already been created, it will be created automatically. Therefore, check if the department is placed correctly in the organisation tree.
8.Internal or external user. Internal and external have the numeric codes 1 and 2, respectively.
9.Birth date, in format dd.mm.yyyy. For example 24.12.1990.

## Roles

Roles are managed per user. Details and roles are changed under each user's profile. See descriptions of roles below.

## What if someone leaves or only works for a limited period?
Use start and end dates to define the access period. Set the end date when a person leaves, and they will be marked as inactive. Inactive users only have access to their own competence and any other published pages. Start and end date can be managed either from the list of users (bulk action) or by person, in user details.
