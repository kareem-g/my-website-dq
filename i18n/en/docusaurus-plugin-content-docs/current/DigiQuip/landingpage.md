# QR codes and NFC tags

For easier access to functions and information, label all equipment with QR codes or NFC tags. Behind the code or tag attached to machines and equipment, users will quickly access various information about the specific work equipment.

## Test out scanning a code:

import GenieGS1932 from '/img/GenieGS1932.png';

<img src={GenieGS1932} style={{width:250}} />

## Is the machine safe to use and can I use it safely?

Safe use requires that both the equipment and the person have the correct status: Is the equipment inspected and can I use the equipment? Here is a description of the content that accompanies the equipment and is presented when the QR code or NFC tag is scanned.

<details>
  <summary>Is expert control required and what's the status?</summary>
  <p>Check if the machine has been inspected and see details of the latest inspection. Everyone who scans the QR code or NFC tag will find this information.</p>
