# Equipment management

## Brand and models

Settings, training materials, user manuals, and checklists are created at the model (aka machine type) level.

:::note[Example, creating checklists]

Why manage equipment on the model level? A company has 1,000 machines across 100 models. How long does it take to set up checklists for all of these? With DigiQuip, the company creates digital checklists per model, i.e., a maximum of 100 checklists. The checklists automatically applies for all 1,000 machines. This is obviously time-saving compared to creating a checklist for each machine or producing 1,000 checklists on paper.

## Create models and add equipment

Add machines manually, via integrations, or import.

**Manually:**

* Step 1: Add a model (machine type). Go to "models>models and details" and select "add". You can now search for the model from the model register and add it. Content such as user manuals and training materials are automatically included (always up-to-date). If the model is not in the model register, create your own model.
* Step 2: Add machines and equipment.

**Import:**
For import, create a CSV or Excel sheet and include brand, model, internal number, and serial number. Then upload the file (CSV or Excel), this option is located under "equipment". The upload may take some time depending on the number of machines and models already in the system. With this method, you do not need to create models manually, as this is done automatically. Note that the serial number must be unique.

:::tip[Remember!]

Correct naming is important. For example, if the brand is written as Caterpillar, Cater, and Catterpillar, these will be created as three different brands.

## Settings

Settings for expert controls, pre-use inspection, and training requirements are located under each model. These settings also control what appears on each equipment page. For instance, if pre-use inspection is unnecessary, it can be removed.

## QR codes and NFC tags

To simplify things for field workers and others on-site, attach QR codes or NFC tags. This makes it easy to access equipment information.

The option to attach QR codes or NFC tags, is located under "equipment > connect QR code/NFC tag".

For associating QR codes and NFC tags, we recommend completing the linking and tagging process in one go. Locate the equipment, attach the tag, then select "assign QR/NFC code". Search for the internal or serial number and finally scan the tag. There's no limit to how many tags can be linked to a piece of equipment. For example, for larger machines, having multiple tags, both external and internal, can be advantageous.

## Integrations

To retrieve machines from "Maskinregisteret", email post@maskinregisteret.no and request API details. This service is free of charge. Enter these details into DigiQuip under settings > general > integrations, or email us for assistance. Only "administrators" have access to this page.

A relatively high share of our customers have custom integrations; please contact us to discuss further arrangements.

# Good luck!
