# Structure

The main purpose of our solutions is to connect people and assets / work equipment through skills and actions. In general, such connections will occur as people acquire skills and perform actions, while assets, usually categorized by brand/model/type, requires specific skills or actions. An example of such a connection is:

***person*** < - > ***acquired skills*** < - > ***skills*** < - > ***required skills*** < - > ***asset type*** < - > ***asset***

## The Key Categories

**Person (Person/People)**
Registry information about an individual, based on first name, last name, date of birth, and nationality.

**Asset Type**
In most cases, this represents a specific model of a particular brand. It can also go down to the version level.

**Asset**
These are individual instances of an asset type, specified with a serial number (or VIN number).
