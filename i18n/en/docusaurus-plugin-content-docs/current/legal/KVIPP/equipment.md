# Equipment
## Identifying Machines and Equipment
Take out your phone and go to kvipp.it

**Artificial intelligence and machine learning** allow you to take a picture of the equipment for recognition. The strategy is to find something on the equipment that displays the type and model. This could be:

+ Serial number plate
+ Brand or logo
+ QR codes. If there is a QR code in the image, the solution is advanced enough to read it as well.

A hack if you can't find something to scan is to write down the type and model on a piece of paper and let the solution read it.

**Scan a QR code** from DigiQuip, Reginn, Kvipp, or BRAREG, and the information will be interpreted.

**Label Work Equipment (Recommended)**
Although the solution uses robust libraries for artificial intelligence and machine learning, there is always a risk that incorrect information will be read and entered. If a person scans a machine and fails to notice that, for example, it is the wrong type, the machine will also be incorrectly registered. This can lead to consequential errors later on, where training that has been carried out may also be documented incorrectly. Therefore, for the best possible accuracy, we recommend that you apply labels.

**Connect a QR code:**
Under "permissions" in Kvipp Business, you define who can connect a QR code. This role is called "equipment owner."

+ Take a picture of the equipment
+ Select "connect QR code"
+ Done!
You can order QR codes from us. See here: digiquip.no/docs/prices/detailed-price-list.
