# Persons and Equipment trainings

## Identifying a Person
Take out your phone and go to kvipp.it  

For identification of a person, the following can be used:
+ HSE card (recommended)
+ Driving licence
+ PocketID
+ Passport
+ Kvipp QR code
We always recommend using the HSE card. By using the HSE card, training is automatically linked to both the correct person and the organisation. This way, the organisation will automatically have an overview of all training ("Kvipp Bedrift").  

## Do you already have equipment-specific training in DigiQuip?
To transfer equipment-specific training from DigiQuip to Kvipp, the following information is required:  

+ First name
+ Last name
+ Date of birth
In this way, we can identify you in both systems.

## Overview of Trainings
In "Kvipp Bedrift", you will find an overview of training. You can either view by person, equipment, or create groups.  

## Who can train on behalf of my organisation?
If you wish to define who is authorised to train on behalf of your organisation, go to "permissions" and select individuals as trainers. In the documentation, it will then indicate that the person has provided training on behalf of the organisation, making it extra traceable.
