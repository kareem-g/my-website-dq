## What personal information does DigiQuip AS have about you?

Personal information is any information that can be linked to you as an individual. We register information such as name, telephone number and email address on our customers' contact persons. DigiQuip's customer base is mainly businesses, but in cases where a private individual is a customer, address will also be registered.

On our customers' user accounts, we register usernames, first names, last names, telephone numbers, email addresses, and which customer the user is linked to.

Personal information associated with our customers' user accounts is necessary to have a unique identity on the user accounts that we can grant access and rights to. User accounts are necessary to fulfill the contract for the delivery of services. Contact information such as email address and telephone number is necessary for the services to function at a technical level, but also to assist users with support functions. Mobile phone numbers are also used for user authentication.

In some cases, personal contact information will be used to notify about service disruptions or relevant changes in the services. Registered contact persons for customers will also receive information and marketing materials related to the services offered up to 2 times per month. We rely on your feedback to work for continuous improvement of our services. This is a central part of our quality management and information security systems. Therefore, we will use name, telephone number, and email address to send you user and customer surveys up to 2 times a year, in accordance with the guidelines in the Personal Data Act ยง 1, cf. GDPR article 6.1 f).

## Geographic storage of personal information
Your personal information is stored in our own systems, which are managed in Norway. Our systems are run by a reputable international cloud provider with distributed data centers all over the world, but are exclusively under our control.

## How long do we store your personal data?
In accordance with the Personal Data Act ยง1, cf. GDPR Article 17, we will not store your personal data for longer than is necessary to carry out the purpose of the processing.

Personal data relating to users is stored as long as the user is active. A user account will be deactivated upon termination, either by the entire customer relationship or by the individual user, and the personal data associated with the user is quarantined for 30 days after deactivation before the user is deleted.

In our case system, information about completed cases relating to individuals is stored as long as the customer relationship is active. Our CRM and ERP systems also store information about customers' contact persons.

At the end of the customer relationship, registered personal data in the case system will be anonymised or deleted after 3 years, in line with the general limitation period. In the CRM and ERP systems, personal data is stored in line with ยง13 of the Bookkeeping Act. This information is anonymised or deleted when the mandatory retention period of 5 years has expired.
